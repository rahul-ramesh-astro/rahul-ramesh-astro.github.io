This file summarises the contents of the TNG50 "Cosmological Cloud Catalog", presented and used in Ramesh+(2023b).

The (hdf5) file consists of various datasets. Each dataset is an array of length 119895, and each entry corresponds to a given cloud. Clouds here are defined as contigous sets of Voronoi cells that are cold (T < 10^{4.5}K). Refer to Ramesh+(2023b) for more details.

01. CloudNumCells: Number of "member" Voronoi cells in the cloud. Fiducial choice in Ramesh+(2023b) corresponds to a minimum of 10 member cells per cloud. 
02. CloudMass: Total mass of the cloud (units: M_\odot).
03. CloudSize: Size of the cloud (units: kpc). The size here is the geometric mean of the lengths of the three axes of the ellipsoid to which vertices of member Voronoi cells are fitted. Refer to Ramesh+(2023b) for more details.
04. CloudDist: Galactocentric distance of (the centre of mass of) this cloud (units: kpc).

05. CloudTemp: Mean temperature of all Voronoi cells that comprise this cloud (units: K).
06. CloudDens: Mean (3D) density of all Voronoi cells that comprise this cloud (units: M_\odot kpc^{-3}).
07. CloudMetal: Mean metallicity of all Voronoi cells that comprise this cloud (units: Z_\odot).
08. CloudMagPres: Mean magnetic pressure of all Voronoi cells that comprise this cloud (units: K cm^{-3}).
09. CloudThmPres: Mean thermal pressure of all Voronoi cells that comprise this cloud (units: K cm^{-3}).
10. CloudRadVel: Mean radial velocity of this cloud (units: km s^{-1}).
11. CloudRotVel: Mean rotational velocity of this cloud (units: km s^{-1}).

12. InterfaceTemp: Mean temperature of all Voronoi cells that comprise the interface layer of this cloud (units: K).
13. InterfaceDens: Mean (3D) density of all Voronoi cells that comprise the interface layer of this cloud (units: M_\odot kpc^{-3}).
14. InterfaceMetal: Mean metallicity of all Voronoi cells that comprise the interface layer of this cloud (units: Z_\odot).
15. InterfaceMagPres: Mean thermal pressure of all Voronoi cells that comprise the interface layer of this cloud (units: K cm^{-3}).
16. InterfaceThmPres: Mean magnetic pressure of all Voronoi cells that comprise the interface layer of this cloud (units: K cm^{-3}).
17. InterfaceRadVel: Mean radial velocity of the interface layer of this cloud (units: km s^{-1}).

18. BackgroundTemp: Mean temperature of all Voronoi cells that comprise the background layer of this cloud (units: K).
19. BackgroundDens: Mean (3D) density of all Voronoi cells that comprise the background layer of this cloud (units: M_\odot kpc^{-3}).
20. BackgroundMetal: Mean metallicity of all Voronoi cells that comprise the background layer of this cloud (units: Z_\odot).
21. BackgroundMagPres: Mean thermal pressure of all Voronoi cells that comprise the background layer of this cloud (units: K cm^{-3}).
22. BackgroundThmPres: Mean magnetic pressure of all Voronoi cells that comprise the background layer of this cloud (units: K cm^{-3}).
23. BackgroundRadVel: Mean radial velocity of the background layer of this cloud (units: km s^{-1}).

24. DistToNearestTenPercentBaryonSatellite: Distance of this cloud to the nearest satellite with a baryon fraction >= 10% (units: kpc). Set to "nan" if no such satellites are present in this halo.

25. SubhaloIdOfHostGalaxy: SubhaloID (i.e. index into the TNG50 Subhalo catalog) of the host galaxy. See https://www.tng-project.org/data/docs/specifications/ for more details.
26. StellarMassOfHostGalaxy: Stellar mass of the host galaxy, measured as the sum of masses of all stars within an aperture of 30kpc (units: M_\odot).
27. SfrOfHostGalaxy: Star formation rate of the host galaxy, measured as the stellar mass formed within an aperture of 30kpc, averaged over the last 1Gyr (units: M_\odot yr^{-1}).
28. BhMassOfHostGalaxy: Mass of the central supermassive black hole of the host galaxy (units: M_\odot).
29. BhMdotOfHostGalaxy: Accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole of the host galaxy (units: M_\odot Gyr^{-1}).
30. M200cOfHostHalo: Virial mass (M_200c) of the host halo (units: M_\odot).
31. R200cOfHostHalo: Virial radius (R_200c) of the host halo (units: kpc).
