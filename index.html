	Hi!

	  I will soon be joining the

  	My research primarily focuses on the halo of gas surrounding galaxies — the so-called Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) — with a particular interest, so far, in galaxies resembling our own Milky Way.
  	I explore this using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical setups:

         Project GIBLE</u>: In order to better study small-scale structure in simulated
         Milky Way-like halos, we run 'CGM zoom-ins' for a subset of galaxies from the TNG50
         MW-like sample. In these GIBLE (Gas Is Better resoLved around galaxiEs) simulations,
         gas in the galaxy is maintained at a resolution equivalent to TNG50-2/TNG100-1, i.e.
         the resolution at which the TNG model is calibrated versus observational constraints.
         However, using our 'CGM Refinement' technique, the underlying distribution of CGM gas
         is preferentially sampled to a better extent. In terms of (CGM gas) resolution, we reach
         a level comparable to some of the best (standard) cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky
         Way-like galaxies run till date (~1000 M_sun). As a result of the added computational efficiency
         of the CGM Refinement scheme, we are able to simulate a larger sample in comparison to the sims
         described above, with Project GIBLE currently comprising of eight MW-like halos. Please see our
         <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230711143R/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intro paper</a>
         for more details.
       </p>

       <p>
        As a first exploration of clouds in GIBLE, we study and quantify the origin and evolution of such 
        objects. We find that the origin of z=0 clouds can be traced back to recent (&lt;2 Gyr) outflows
        from the central galaxy (~45%), condensation out of the hot phase of the CGM in the same time 
        frame (~45%), and to a lesser degree to satellite galaxies (&lt;5%). The remainder of the cloud 
        population is long lived, with their progenitors having already assembled ~2 Gyr ago. Collective 
        cloud-cloud dynamics are crucial to their evolution, with coalescence and fragmentation events 
        occurring frequently (&gt;20 per Gyr). In addition, these clouds exchange matter with their ambient 
        backgrounds at a typical rate of a few million M_sun per Myr, modulated by properties such as the 
        velocity contrast, interface vorticity, effective magnetic tension, amongst other quantities. Please see our
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240700172R/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
         paper</a> for additional details and discussion.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a couple of halos from this sample, we improve the resolution further, reaching an unprecedented 
        average gas mass of ~225 M_sun in the CGM. We make use of these runs to study the topology of magnetic
        field lines around cold CGM gas clouds. We find large diversity across the sample, from threading to 
        draping, and there is large variation in the magnetic curvature within cloud-background interfaces.

        <u>
         Illuminating a Cosmological Box with Cosmic Rays</u>: As a first attempt towards including cosmic ray (CR) 
         physics in large volume cosmological simulations designed to statistically reproduce the <em>real</em> universe and assessing
         their impact on z=0 galaxy, circumgalactic medium (CGM), and halo properties, we run a suite of 25 Mpc/h 
         boxes with the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model in conjunction with
        <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.2936H" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
         this</a> simple CR scheme. We select transport parameters that yield a reasonable trade off between
         realistic large-scale integrated properties, and galactic CR pressure profiles predicted by more complex 
         models. The resulting simulations show that, at fixed halo mass, including CRs does not strongly impact
         the temperature, density, or (total) pressure structure of the CGM with respect to the fiducial TNG model.
         However, cosmic rays add significant non-thermal pressure support to the halo. This suppresses the star 
         formation activity and thus stellar masses of galaxies, from dwarf to L* halos. The cosmic star formation
         rate density, stellar mass function, and stellar mass to halo mass relation are all reshaped by CRs. Galaxy
         sizes and halo-scale gas fractions are more mildly affected, while lower gas densities in the interstellar 
         medium inhibit supermassive black hole growth. Halo gas is also less magnetized, and less metal enriched. 
         These differences are primarily driven by suppressed gas accretion onto halos and galaxies, as well as weaker 
         galactic outflows in the presence of CRs. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with previous studies 
         of the impact of CRs on galactic outflows, and motivate the inclusion of CR physics in future large-scale 
         cosmological simulations. For more details, please see our paper

         Paper I</a>, we analyze various physical properties of gas: (i) integrated properties across the halo,
         and (ii) radial profiles. Both show large variation across our sample of galaxies, as can be visualized in this
        <a href="https://www.tng-project.org/explore/gallery/ramesh22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
         infinite gallery</a>, as a combined result of many factors. One of these factors is the feedback energy
         injected by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which we explore in this paper: in TNG50, 
         kinetic winds driven by the SMBH heat gas to super-virial temperatures, generate high-velocity 
         outflows, and regulate the net balance of inflows versus outflows in otherwise quasi-static halos.

         CGM Magnetic Field Strength Profiles are Azimuthally Anisotropic</u>: We study the impact of galactic
         feedback processes on the angular structure of CGM B-fields using the TNG50 simulations. Despite isotropic
         energy injections by SN and AGN feedback, outflows tend to be preferentially oriented perpendicular to 
         the galactic disk, owing to lower gas densities along these paths. This alignment of outflows gradually 
         leaves an imprint on the angular structure of CGM gas properties, including B-fields, with stronger field 
         strengths closer to the minor axis. We find that the level of anisotropy peaks around the Milky Way mass, 
         and decreases in magnitude in more massive galaxies as AGN feedback quenches and ultimately destroys 
         the underlying disk structure. For more details, please see our paper

         Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves</u>: Akin to electromagnetic radiation, gravitational 
         waves are deflected by 'massive' objects as they propagate past them. However, their wavelengths 
         are typically larger than their electromagnetic counterparts. As a result, in certain cases, their 
         wave nature cannot be ignored, like is usually done while studying lensing of electromagnetic waves. 
         In this project, we study the impact that these 'wave effects' have on observed signals. In

         Paper I</a>, we focus on the (micro-)lensing of stochastic gravitational waves, similar to those 
         produced during core-collapse supernovae. In addition, we explore more complicated scenarios of 
         lensing, wherein matter responsible for producing the above mentioned lensing effects are 
         distributed along multiple lens planes 
         (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43...38R/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper II</a>).
